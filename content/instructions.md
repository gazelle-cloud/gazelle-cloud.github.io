# Writing Style Guide for Personal Platform Documentation

## Format & Structure
- Use a structured, docs-like layout with **clear headings** 
- Start with the technical explanation, then add design rationale or clarifications if needed.
- Use bullet points for lists of behaviors, constraints, or steps.

## Tone
- Professional, but approachable—think "engineering blog post for peers."
- No jokes, gimmicks, or “clever” one-liners
- Flow naturally with connective phrases where needed, but keep wording tight.
- Assume the reader is technical and familiar with Azure, GitHub Actions, and platform engineering. No need to oversimplify.

## Content Style
- Be explicit about technical details.
- State constraints directly, if it exists
- Integrate proof points naturally—concise, embedded in the flow.
- Call out defaults and note what can be changed.

## Decision Reasoning
- Explain decisions in 2-4 sentences.

## What’s Allowed
- First-person (“I,”) when it helps explain process or reasoning.
- Light connective phrasing to keep text readable
- Direct, factual proof of use

## What to Avoid
- Marketing language (*"robust," "seamless," "enterprise-ready"*).
- Clever or cheap-sounding phrases
- Overlong examples when one concise sentence will do.
- Storytelling or metaphors—stick to factual, technical explanation.

## output
- format in markdown
