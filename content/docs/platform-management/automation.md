Platform automation is powered by Azure Container App Jobs. The service is optimized for running scheduled automation flows with minimal infrastructure overhead. 

### Automation identity

A single user-assigned managed identity is reused across all automation jobs. This identity is granted `Contributor` permissions at the top-level management group and Microsoft Graph API permissions to read `Users` and `Groups` in Entra ID. All jobs authenticate using this identity.
{{< callout type="info" >}}
Entra ID Graph API permissions are assigned using a classic deployment, because Deployment Stacks do not support deleting Entra ID objects that are no longer defined in the templates.

{{< /callout >}}  

Instead of creating separate identities and assigning precise roles per job, a unified identity is used across all automation. This simplifies management and reduces overheadâ€”even if it technically grants broader permissions than each job strictly requires.

To mitigate risk, access is tightly controlled through centralized and secure source control: all automation jobs are maintained in a single GitHub repository, with access limited to a small group of trusted engineers. Every change is reviewed through pull requests, ensuring that automation scripts are vetted before execution.
   
### Job Execution
 
  - **Triggering**: All jobs use cron-based scheduling.
  - **Naming Convention**: Jobs follow a consistent naming pattern: `cron-`.
  - **Network Access**: The Container Apps Environment is configured to block all public network access and does not have virtual network integration. As a result, automation jobs are limited to control-plane operations only.
  - **Access Control**: The automation identity is automatically assigned to every job, enabling full access to Azure.
  - **Logging**: Execution logs are sent to the platform Log Analytics workspace for monitoring.

### Packaging & Parameters

  - **Script Bundling**: All scripts are bundled into a single container image and published to the GitHub Container Registry.
  - **Script Mapping**: Each job must have the same name as the PowerShell script it executes.
  - **Parameters**: Job-specific inputs are passed as environment variables, defined in a parameter file for each script.
