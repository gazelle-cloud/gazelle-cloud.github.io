Service-Oriented Principles in Gazelle’s Modular Platform Architecture
SOA Principles: Separation of Concerns and Loose Coupling
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is founded on the idea of breaking down large systems into smaller, self-contained services – an application of the “separation of concerns” principle

. Each service addresses a specific business function or concern, encapsulating its internal logic and exposing only a defined interface to the outside world. In fact, classical SOA design principles assert that services should be loosely coupled, autonomous units of logic that interact through well-defined contracts

. In practice, this means each service can evolve on its own lifecycle (developed, deployed, and scaled independently) and only communicates with others through a formal interface (often an API or message contract) rather than direct linkages

. This approach yields systems that are composable and easier to change or extend – new services can be added or replaced without disrupting existing ones, so long as they honor the same contracts. The net result is a more modular, maintainable architecture where each part does one job and does it well.
Gazelle’s Building Blocks as Independent Services
Gazelle – an open-source platform for managing Azure landing zones entirely as code – employs a modular “building block” architecture that mirrors these SOA principles. Each building block in Gazelle focuses on a narrow responsibility within the platform and is delivered via its own isolated pipeline, effectively acting like an independent service. For example, Gazelle defines distinct building blocks such as Tenant Level, Monitor, Access Control, Automation, and Policy, each addressing a separate aspect of the platform. The Monitor block sets up core monitoring services (Log Analytics workspaces, alerts, action groups) for the platform’s logging and observability needs. The Access Control block manages identity and access management, deploying custom role definitions and assignments to ensure the right Azure RBAC roles are in place. Meanwhile, the Automation block encapsulates operational jobs (using Azure Container App Jobs) that perform scheduled maintenance and cleanup tasks to keep the environment healthy. Crucially, each building block is implemented, tested, and deployed independently. Every platform capability “ships through its own pipeline,” handling all steps from provisioning to teardown within that module’s scope. This means the Access Control pipeline can run and update IAM roles without needing to coordinate with the Monitor or Automation pipelines, for instance. By designing the platform as small, task-oriented modules – each solving one problem, and solving it well, Gazelle achieves a clear separation of concerns akin to microservices. Each block has its own codebase (Bicep templates and parameters), its own lifecycle (CI/CD workflow in GitHub), and its own state, making it fully encapsulated. If the team needs to modify how monitoring works, they can do so in the Monitor module’s pipeline and release that change on its own schedule, without fear of side effects in the access control or policy components.
Contract-Based Interaction via Outputs
Just as SOA services communicate through formal contracts or APIs, Gazelle’s building blocks interact only through explicit outputs and shared variables – never through hidden shared state or tight integration. Dependencies between building blocks are managed using GitHub Variables, where one block can publish an output (such as an Azure resource ID) that another block’s pipeline can consume. For example, after the Monitor block provisions a Log Analytics workspace, it might output the workspace’s resource ID to a GitHub repository variable. The Policy or Automation block can then read that ID from the repository variables if needed, rather than the Monitor block directly calling them. In practice, these outputs function like interfaces between platform components: “Each functional unit exposes only the values others need – such as workspace IDs or resource IDs – without revealing internal logic or structure”. This design is essentially a contract-based interaction. The format and meaning of the data (the “contract”) is agreed upon, but how each block produces or uses that data internally is its own concern. By using outputs as the only communication mechanism, Gazelle’s building blocks remain loosely coupled. No building block reaches into another’s internals; they don’t directly invoke each other’s functions or share databases. Instead, each module publishes what is necessary and subscribes (via reading variables) to what it needs. This mirrors the SOA emphasis on formal contracts and independence: if one building block changes its internal implementation or resource details, it just needs to continue providing the expected outputs for others to continue functioning. The others are unaffected by the change as long as the interface (the output contract) remains consistent. This level of encapsulation makes the entire platform more resilient and adaptable – components can be added, removed, or altered with minimal ripple effects, since interactions are limited to those well-defined outputs.
Benefits of a Modular, SOA-Inspired Approach
Adopting this SOA-like, building-block architecture for an Azure platform brings a number of concrete benefits:
Easier Testing & Validation in Isolation: Because each Gazelle building block is self-contained, it can be deployed and verified on its own. Engineers can run a building block’s pipeline in a test environment (which mirrors production) to validate changes without impacting other parts of the platform. Loosely coupled services enable this kind of isolated testing; each component can be evaluated independently, supporting more reliable continuous integration and delivery

. Problems are easier to pinpoint and address, since the scope of any given pipeline run is limited to a single concern.
Faster Iteration & Reduced Blast Radius: With independent lifecycles, teams can iterate on one building block quickly without needing to redeploy or retest the entire platform. A change to the Automation service (say, adding a new job) can be rolled out on its own cadence. This not only speeds up development cycles, but also reduces the blast radius of changes – a bug in one module is unlikely to bring down everything else. In a loosely coupled system, if one service encounters an issue or goes down, it does not cascade to others

. Gazelle’s design ensures that a malfunction in, for example, the monitoring component won’t prevent the access control or policy components from functioning (the platform remains “undisturbed” even if one piece needs a fix

). In short, failures or updates are contained within their domain, making the overall platform more robust and resilient.
Clear Separation of Responsibilities: Each building block has a well-defined purpose and owns a specific set of tasks, which fosters clarity in both development and operations. Engineers know exactly where to look when an access issue or a policy compliance question arises – the code and configuration live in the corresponding module. This alignment of one concern per service improves maintainability and governance. It also means teams can work in parallel on different blocks without stepping on each other’s toes. The single-responsibility approach internally (and across modules) ensures that modifications in one area don’t unintentionally affect others. In Gazelle, if you need to adjust a security policy, you do so in the Policy block, confident that this change won’t break the monitoring setup or automation jobs. The clarity of boundaries increases team autonomy and accelerates onboarding, since each component’s scope and contract are documented and limited.
Conclusion: Reflection on Composability and Platform Engineering Values
Personally, the elegance of Gazelle’s modular architecture resonates strongly with my experience in platform engineering. It embodies the principle of “composability” – the idea that you can build complex systems by assembling small, well-defined pieces. This aligns with the core values of platform engineering such as reproducibility, clarity, and operational autonomy. For instance, because each building block is defined as code and can be torn down or rebuilt independently, the entire platform remains reproducible by design – we can confidently perform a full “Big Bang” deployment from scratch, knowing that every piece will configure itself correctly in isolation. The clarity that comes from separation of concerns means every team member or application owner can understand the platform’s components without wading through unrelated logic. Finally, the autonomous nature of each service (and by extension, each application team’s landing zone) reinforces a “you build it, you run it” philosophy. Teams are empowered to manage their own environments within guardrails, which fosters a culture of ownership and speed. In summary, Gazelle’s SOA-inspired approach not only makes technical sense for reliability and maintainability – it also creates an environment of trust and agility, where independent modules (and teams) can move fast, innovate safely, and stand on a solid, code-defined foundation. This harmony between architectural principles and engineering culture is why Gazelle’s design truly strikes a chord with me.
